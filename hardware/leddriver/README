As usual, the first revision (V1) of the board includes some mistakes.
These are the necessary fixes (see fixesV1.JPG):

1. Do not populate R2.
2. Do not populate R14.
3. Do not populate Q3. Instead short its base and collector and add a resistor of approx. 10k between the emitter and collector.
4. Add a 100nF capacitor from IC1 pin 13 to ground.
5. Add a 100nF capacitor on top of R9.
6. Add a 100nF capacitor on top of R12.
7. Add a 1k resistor from R15 to ground.

These are fixed in V1.1. But since V1 is working well, V1.1 will probably never be build, is therefore untested and might contain further errors.
